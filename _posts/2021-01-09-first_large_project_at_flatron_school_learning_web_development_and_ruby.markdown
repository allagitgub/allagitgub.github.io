As an experienced developer I thought that any software development project will be a piece of cake for me. To my surprise I found myself stuck and and worried when I first read the requirement for the CLI project. Here are my observations on what helped me get over the blocks and continue.
1. Picking the topic on which I write a CLI seemed hard, where do I start... I started with remembering what websites I visited/used recently that had the follwoing model, a page with high level topics of some sort which go into more detail by clicking into them. A few came to mind - TimeOut website, and NutritionFacts.org, I picked the latter but maybe the first idea will help someone else.
2. Where do I start. Start small with trying to scrape the pages you found and use Scraper Checker, it helped me a lot to identify the right tags to scrape.
3. Watch the Video on Eden Events, at least the begging of it, if you are not experience program, watch everytihng. It will show you that even experienced programmers do it by trial and error..
4. Gradually add functionality to your program, it doesn't have to be perfect to start with, you can make it pretty at the end.
5. Keep working on it everyday, when I spkipped days it was harder to get back. When I kept going it felt good and gave me satisfaction.
6. Search the internet, it has a lot of information on everything and you can find answers on pretty much every programming topic.
